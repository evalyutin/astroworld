<p class="p2">Just like every celebrity, <span class="highlight">Travis Scott</span> uses social media daily, dropping hints about his highly-anticipated <span class="highlight">'Astroworld'</span> album,leaving everyone confused and frustrated.</p>
<p class="p2">Scott’s been spotted in the studio with <span class="highlight">PARTYNEXTDOOR</span> and <span class="highlight">Tame Impala</span>. Who else did Scott link up with on his new album?</p>

<p class="p2">Similar to <span class="highlight">Kanye’s</span> group trips to Wyoming to finish ‘ye, Travis Scott has gone to <span class="highlight">Hawaii</span> to put the final touches on Astroworld, alongside a host of producers including <span class="highlight">Mike Dean, Sonny Digital, WondaGurl, Wheezy, NAV, Amir “Cash” Esmailian, Frank Dukes, Gunna, Don Toliver, Sheck Wes and Allen Ritter</span>.</p>

<p class="p2">When will it come out? No one knows.</p>
<p class="p2">More fuel was added to the fire, when <span class="highlight">Mike Dean</span> shared a photo of a <span class="highlight">hard drive of the album</span> suggesting it was ready to go. On Wed 18 July, Travis reportedly stopped by his label, <span class="highlight">Epic records</span>, to play them the album too. The office was seen decked out with <span class="highlight">‘Astroworld’ banners</span>.</h3>

<p class="p2">In a <span class="highlight">Rolling Stone profile</span> from earlier this year, Scott elaborates on the now-defunct <span class="highlight">Astroworld amusement park</span> – “It had a Dungeon Drop, Greezed Lightnin’, Superman,” he recalls. <span class="highlight">“It was a way of life – fantasies, imagination.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">According to the album’s page on <span class="highlight">Genius</span>, Astroworld is “slated for a <span class="highlight">2018 release</span>.”</p>
<p class="p2">At a performance in <span class="highlight">August 2017</span>, Travis Scott said he was <span class="highlight">“going into hiding”</span> to work on two albums – Astroworld and a collaborative project with <span class="highlight">Quavo</span>, which was finally released as <span class="highlight">Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho</span> at the end of December 2017.</p>

<p class="p2">Astroworld could include a sequel to <span class="highlight">“Drugs You Should Try It”</span> off of Travis Scott’s <span class="highlight">2014 mixtape Days Before Rodeo</span>, according to an Instagram post by Atlanta production duo <span class="highlight">FKi</span> 1st who worked on the original track.</p>


<p class="p2">Astroworld might feature <span class="highlight">Kanye West</span>: “Kanye, he’s my buddy. When I got the chance to meet him I was so nervous. He listened to my music and thought it was cool. Two weeks later he sent me an email and I found myself on the way to Paris to take part in his <span class="highlight">Yeezus album</span>,” he said in an interview with <span class="highlight">Numéro Homme</span> from March.</p>

<p class="p2">Back in <span class="highlight">October</span>, OVO crooner <span class="highlight">PARTYNEXTDOOR</span> was spotted in the studio with Travis Scott, sparking rumors they’re working together on Astroworld.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class"highlight">It’s not going to be your average rap album</span>.</p>
<p class="p2">“What the fuck is a <span class="highlight">rapper</span>? I dunno. A country singer, it doesn’t mean anything anymore. No one is a country singer unless he wants to get stuck in one single genre. Me, I sing, I rap, I do beats, I sometimes make videos. <span class="highlight">Labels piss me off</span>,” he explained to Numéro Homme.</p>
<p class="p2">The ‘Astroworld’ Tour will have <span class="highlight">amusement park rides</span>, naturally.</h3>
<p class="p2">“I don’t know why it hasn’t been done already – I think people just don’t do shit. <span class="highlight">Who makes stages these days that are cool</span>?” Scott explained in that Rolling Stone interview.</p>
