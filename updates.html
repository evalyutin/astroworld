<h5>UPDATES</h5>
<h6>EVERYTHING WE KNOW SO FAR</h6>
<h3>Just like every celebrity, Travis Scott uses social media daily, dropping hints about his highly-anticipated 'Astroworld' album,leaving everyone confused and frustrated.</h3>
<h3>Scott’s been spotted in the studio with PARTYNEXTDOOR and Tame Impala. Who else did Scott link up with on his new album?</h3>
<h3>As far as we know, Scott was in Hawaii a few days ago, finishing up his album. Alongside a host of producers including Mike Dean, Sonny Digital, WondaGurl, Wheezy, NAV, Amir “Cash” Esmailian, Frank Dukes, Gunna, Don Toliver, Sheck Wes and Allen Ritter.</h3>
<h3>When will it come out? No eone knows.</h3>
<h3>More fuel was added to the fire, when Mike Dean shared a photo of a hard drive of the album suggesting it was ready to go. On Wed 18 July, Travis reportedly stopped by his label, Epic records, to play them the album too. The office was seen decked out with ‘Astroworld’ banners.</h3>

<h3>In a Rolling Stone profile from earlier this year, Scott elaborates on the now-defunct Astroworld amusement park – “It had a Dungeon Drop, Greezed Lightnin’, Superman,” he recalls. “It was a way of life – fantasies, imagination.”</h3>
<h3>According to the album’s page on Genius, Astroworld is “slated for a 2018 release.”</h3>
<h3>At a performance in August 2017, Travis Scott said he was “going into hiding” to work on two albums – Astroworld and a collaborative project with Quavo, which was finally released as Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho at the end of December 2017.</h3>

<h3>“Butterfly Effect” is the lead single of Astroworld.</h3>
<h3>Astroworld could include a sequel to “Drugs You Should Try It” off of Travis Scott’s 2014 mixtape Days Before Rodeo, according to an Instagram post by Atlanta production duo FKi 1st who worked on the original track.</h3>
<h3>Astroworld might feature Kanye West: “Kanye, he’s my buddy. When I got the chance to meet him I was so nervous. He listened to my music and thought it was cool. Two weeks later he sent me an email and I found myself on the way to Paris to take part in his Yeezus album,” he said in an interview with Numéro Homme from March.</h3>
<h3>Back in October, OVO crooner PARTYNEXTDOOR was spotted in the studio with Travis Scott, sparking rumors they’re working together on Astroworld.</h3>

<h3>It’s not going to be your average rap album.</h3>
<h3>“What the fuck is a rapper? I dunno. A country singer, it doesn’t mean anything anymore. No one is a country singer unless he wants to get stuck in one single genre. Me, I sing, I rap, I do beats, I sometimes make videos. Labels piss me off,” he explained to Numéro Homme.</h3>
<h3>The ‘Astroworld’ Tour will have amusement park rides, naturally.</h3>
<h3>“I don’t know why it hasn’t been done already – I think people just don’t do shit. Who makes stages these days that are cool?” Scott explained in that Rolling Stone interview.</h3>
