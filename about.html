  <p class="p2">Scott has a heavily Auto-Tuned half-sung/half-rapped vocal style, and refers to himself as a singer rather than a rapper. He's produced or co-produced tracks by Kanye West, Rihanna, and Drake, and he's appeared on tracks by Jay-Z, Pusha T, Meek Mill, and numerous others.</p>
  <p class="p2">Scott grew up in a suburb of Houston and began making music as a teenager. He formed a duo called the Graduates with Chris Holloway, and they released an EP in 2009.</p>
  <p class="p2">He went to Elkins High School before going to the University of Texas at San Antonio and later dropped out to start a music career. He signed his first major label with Epic Records in 2012.</p>
  <p class="p2">The buildup to Scott's first proper studio album involved the Days Before Rodeo mixtape, promoted with the singles "Don't Play" and "Mamacita," and the March 2015 U.S. Rodeo Tour, for which Scott headlined, supported by Young Thug and Metro Boomin.</p>
  <p class="p2">Titled Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, after one of Quavo's lines in "Pick Up the Phone," the woozy, mostly midtempo set featured that hit and contributions from the likes of André 3000, Kid Cudi, and Kendrick Lamar. It went straight to the top of the Billboard 200.</p>
  <p class="p2">As of 2018, Travis Scott's net worth comes to an estimated $8 million (£5.3 million) thanks to his musical endeavours.</p>
  <p class="p2">Travis has been dating US reality TV star Kylie Jenner since April 2017. Rumours began swirling that Kylie was pregnant with Scott's child in September 2017. Following months of speculation, the birth of their daughter Stormi was announced on 4th February 2018.</p>
